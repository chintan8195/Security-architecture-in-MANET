##### Description
Designed an algorithm by implementing trust computation and cluster formation to ensure authentication in nodes so that
security can be achieved and selfish nodes can be isolated from the network with less memory and computational
capabilities

##### Abstract

Collaborative computing is the new paradigm of computing in the industry towards saving time and cost. As Information and Communication Technology grows, further digital communication becomes an unavoidable part in a collaborative computing environment and such technologies have become a part of any organization. In this project ,we propose how the collaborative computing for a project environment is carried out with the help of Mobile AdHoc Network and security related issues have long been investigated in MANET due to its distinct nature. Moreover traditional security mechanisms are not well suited for MANET
because they are centralized, static and they also require huge memory and high computational power and it leads to processing overhead and bandwidth consumption. So in order to overcome such issues, we propose trust in this context to ensure the authentication by the way security can be achieved and selfish nodes can be isolated from the network with less memory and computational capabilities because our proposed algorithm does not involve complex computation. In addition, by making use of trust, clusters can be formed. Hence scalability issues are effectively addressed and we also justify Mobile Ad Hoc Network for project environment over traditional network and discuss its significance.

##### Proposed System

Collaborative computing allows users to work together on documents and
projects usually in real time, by taking the advantage of underlying network
communications systems.
* Here the communication system works on Mobile Ad hoc Networks
generally identified as MANET here open and shared mobile nodes are
connected together over a structure less wireless network.
* Henceforth they do not be subjected to any fixed infrastructure similar to the
traditional wireless and wired networks.
* Going to these forms of networks does not demand any dedicated router for
forwarding the packets rather each node acts as a router.
* These types of networks can be easily deployed and it is a temporary
network. Nodes in the MANET are moving without any restrictions hence
the topology of network could frequently change.
* We make use of this network for collaborative project environment and this
application runs on the top of MANET even if traditional network is
available for such collaborative environment, growth enables us to make
use of such distinct network with some benefits
